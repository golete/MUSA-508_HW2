CORRELATION NOTES
- logPrice is better than price (stronger correlation)
- age and newConstruction are BAD
- effectiveAge2 is marginally better than effectiveAge, but neither is great
- qualityNum > qualityNum2
- TotalFinishedSF > mainfloorSF
- nbrRooms > nbrRoomsNobath > nbrBedRoom (colineariy with sq ft?)
- totalBaths2 > totalBathOrShower >= totalBaths > nbrFullBaths > nbrThreeQtrBaths > nbrHalfBaths
- carStorageSF >>> garageDummy >= carStorageDummy
- bsmtSF > finishedBasement > walkOutBasement > basementDummy (colinearity?)

DUMMY CORRELATION NOTES
- basement correlations weaker categorical than recoded; maybe try both but probably keep recoded (penalty for no basement category, though?)
- try garage both ways? but maybe just carStorageSF
- year/quarter sold: try both ways
- dummy variables with colinearity issues:
	-basementLOWER LVL GARDEN FINISHED (BI-SPLIT LVL)
	-carStorageATTACHED GARAGE AREA
	-acTypeUnspecified
	-heatingTypeUnspecified
	-constMatUnspecified
	-"None" variables (better as simple dummies?)
