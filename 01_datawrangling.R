# SFHA means Special Flood Hazard Area
#  TRUE, FALSE or NA

# FLD_ZONE        High-risk areas have at least a 1% annual chance of flooding.  This flood is also referred to as the Base Flood.  Flood insurance is required for structures in these high-risk areas if they have a federally-backed mortgage.
#  ZONE AE        Area inundated by the Base Flood with Base Flood Elevations determined.
#  ZONE AH        Area inundated by the Base Flood with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); Base Flood Elevations determined.
#  ZONE AO        Area inundated by the Base Flood with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths determined. For areas of alluvial fan flooding, velocities are also determined.
#  ZONE X (0.2%)  This zone designation is for multiple risks including areas of the 0.2% annual chance flood; areas of the 1% annual chance flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with drainage areas less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by levees from the 1% annual chance flood.
#  ZONE X         Areas determined to be outside the 0.2% annual chance floodplain. 

# ZONE_SUBTY
#  0500 0.2 PCT ANNUAL CHANCE FLOOD HAZARD FIRM
#  1000 AREA WITH REDUCED FLOOD RISK DUE TO LEVEE FIRM
#  1100 FLOODWAY
